# Circle-Detector

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project is for initial orientation with the OpenCV libraries. I wanted to create a program that would dynamically read an arbitary number of images, and do some sort of OpenCV detection with the image data. 

## Learning Goals:

This are the learning Goals for this project
* familiarity with OpenCV
* familiarity with File.io
* reorientation to Ubuntu C++ coding enviroments

## Tutorials:

These are the tutorials and documentation that I used when creating this project
